      <description>In this second part of the series I will walk through on how Magenta works and How I tweaked it to adapt to my application needs.
Magenta core Magenta is a library built on top of Tensorflow that helps you generate music using machine learning. It has in its core a music representation abstraction much like MIDI that they call NoteSequence. Basically it is a sequence of events in which each event is a well defined note.</description>

      <description>In this series I&amp;rsquo;ll go through on how I did an app that streams songs generated by artificial intelligence.
What will be covered ?  Discussion on the system design for this simple application. Brief discussion on how music is generated by AI Implementation details with code samples.  Artificial intelligence is capable of composing compelling music ? The short answer is: it depends. First of all, music taste is something unique to each person.</description>
