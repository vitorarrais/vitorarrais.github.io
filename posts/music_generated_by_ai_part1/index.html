<p>In this series I&rsquo;ll explain how I did an app that streams songs generated by artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-gonna-cover">What am I gonna cover ?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Discussion on the system design for this simple application.</li>
<li>Brief discussion on how music is generated by AI</li>
<li>Implementation details of a AI powered server in python, a Webserver in Nodejs and an Android app.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-is-capable-of-composing-compelling-music">Artificial intelligence is capable of composing compelling music ?</h2>

<p>The short answer is: it depends. First of all, music taste is something unique to each person. What sounds good to me maybe does not sound good to you. AI may compose music in many different ways, but here I&rsquo;ll focus in songs entirely composed from scratch
by AI. In one way or another, AI generating music is itself something impressive.</p>

<h2 id="how-ai-creates-music">How AI creates music ?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re capable to train Machine Learning models over a dataset of thousands of songs. After trained, this model has learned
how to compose music based on a thousand of songs. Machine learning models are capable of extracting
music patterns from bits and reproduce them.</p>

<h2 id="google-magenta">Google Magenta</h2>

<p>Google Magenta is a project from Google Brain that focus in Machine learning models in the field of music generation.
There are a bunch of other alternatives out there, as IBM Watson, but Magenta is open source and very promising.</p>

<h2 id="prove-of-concept">Prove of concept</h2>

<p>In order to prove the concept that AI can compose music, I came with this project idea. The idea is simple, an app powered
by AI that generate songs according to someone&rsquo;s pace. In other words, IA will track your speed using your mobile and will
create songs based on that.</p>

<h2 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h2>

<p>We gonna need:
  - A server hosting the AI model
  - A client application that plays music
  - A webserver serving as bridge between both</p>

<p>The webserver is optional, you can host the ML model together with the server that communicates with the client. But I kind like microservices architecture so I decided to keep them separate.
Since I&rsquo;ve choose Magenta as my intelligent music generator and Magenta is distributed in Python, It is just easier to write a
server in Python too and simply import the modules I need.
For the client I&rsquo;ve choose an Android app that I did a couple of years ago. The app was powered with Spotify API but now I&rsquo;ll
replace it with my own AI powered API.
Finally, for the webserver I wrote it using Nodejs. I always wanted to try it and it was just the right chance to do so :)</p>

<p>So, the whole (but simple) architecture looks like this</p>

<p>&ndash; &gt; image goes here &lt; &ndash;</p>

<p>The way all components work together is like the following. The app keep tracking your pace using the GPS of your mobile phone and keep sending updates to the webserver. Then the webserver create a TCP socket with the AI server in order to request for
songs and to receive them. As soon as the AI server receives a requests, it uses a pre-trained ML model to generate a new song and send it back to the webserver that, finally, pipe it back to the client.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-next-step">Conclusion and Next step</h2>

<p>The most important thing here is to understand the capabilities of AI in terms of music generation. We also discussed how a app like this should be structured.</p>

<p>Later on, in the part 2 of the series I will discuss more how I used Magenta to compose songs. Stay tuned!</p>
